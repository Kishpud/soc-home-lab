Documenting my SOC lab with Zeek, Suricata, and log analysis  # 🛡️ Home SOC Lab by Kishor Pudasaini

This project documents my self-built Security Operations Center (SOC) lab running on Ubuntu, featuring:

- 🔍 Zeek for network traffic analysis
- 📄 Log parsing and detection scripts
- 🔧 Simulated attacker behavior

## 🧪 Lab Objectives
- Parse PCAPs and generate logs
- Detect brute-force attacks and suspicious connections
- Automate log extraction and alert simulation
- Document everything for public learning

## 📂 Structure
- `zeek/`: configs, logs, scripts
- `attack-simulations/`: commands used to simulate threats
- `notes/`: how-tos, installation steps, configs

## 📸 Screenshots
Coming soon!

## 🚧 Roadmap
